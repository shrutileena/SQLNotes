Check Constraint is used to specify a predicate that every tuple must satisfy in a given relation. It limits the values that a column can hold in a relation.

The predicate in check constraint can hold a sub query.
Check constraint defined on an attribute restricts the range of values for that attribute.
If the value being added to an attribute of a tuple violates the check constraint, the check constraint evaluates to false and the corresponding update is aborted.
Check constraint is generally specified with the CREATE TABLE command in SQL.

CREATE TABLE pets(
        ID INT NOT NULL,
        Name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
        Breed VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
        Age INT,
        GENDER VARCHAR(9),
        PRIMARY KEY(ID),
        check(GENDER in ('Male', 'Female', 'Unknown'))
        );
