Session 7:

=============================

select distinct source_of_joining from students order by enrollment_date desc;

Distinct and Order By in the same Query.It doesn't work


case 1:

select source_of_joining from students

Order of execution:
=============================

1) From (Loading the Table)

2) Select (Projecting source_of_joining)

case 2:

select source_of_joing, enrollment_date from students.

Order of execution:
=============================

1) From (Loading the Table)
select * from students;

2) Select (Projecting source_of_joining and source_of_joining)

case 3:

select source_of_joing, enrollment_date from students order by enrollment_date;

Order of execution:
=============================

1) From (Loading the Table)
select * from students;

2) Select (Projecting source_of_joining and source_of_joining)

3) Order By (based on enrollment_date it will order by)


case 4:

select source_of_joing from students order by enrollment_date;


Order of execution:
=============================

1) From (Loading the Table)
select * from students;

2) Select (Projecting source_of_joining , enrollment_date) // system needs enrollment_date for ordering, so it will still project this column, we can't discard it as it is needed by the system


select source_of_joining,enrollment_date from students;

3) Order By (based on enrollment_date it will order by)



case 5:

select distinct source_of_joining from students order by enrollment_date;

Order of execution:
=============================

1) From (Loading the Table)
select * from students;

2) Select (Projecting source_of_joining , enrollment_date)  // system needs enrollment_date for ordering, so it will still project this column, we can't discard it as it is needed by the system

select source_of_joining,enrollment_date from students;

3) distinct //distinct will happen on both of columns because system has to take both for ordering by; So instead of "select distinct source_of_joining from students", this query is fired "select distinct source_of_joining,enrollment_date from students";
So, distinct will happen on combination of both the columns; logically it is wrong

select distinct source_of_joining,enrollment_date from students;

3) Order By (based on enrollment_date it will order by)
